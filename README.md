# DVDO iScan Serial Control

Python app to control the DVDO iScan Video Processors through an RS232 serial connection via CLI or MQTT.

| Supports | Tested |
| -------- | ------ |
| VP50 Pro | yes    |
| VP50     | no     |
| VP30     | no     |
| VP20     | no     |

Theoretically the DVDO iScan HD, HD+ and Duo could also be supported, but there was no documentation about the serial protocol or the codes so I can't guarantee that it'll work.

## Example Usage via CLI

Check `example-cli.py` to see how to use the app via cli.

## MQTT
